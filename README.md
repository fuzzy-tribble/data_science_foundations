# Data Science Foundations
*Interactive workbooks that help you learn and master essentail data science skills.*

I recomend that you go through the workbooks in the following order as they do build on each other.

- Numpy and Matplotlib
- Pandas and Seaborn
- Linear Algebra Foundations
- Linear Algebra Algorithms

# Repo Structure

`/docs`: Contains the configs for the github pages website

`/notebooks`: Contains the ipython notebooks (.ipynb)

# Usage

You can either [reference the workbook content online](https://nancynobody.github.io/python3_fluency) or run workbooks interactively (locally or online).

## To run the workbooks interactively...
There are several options for running the workbooks interactively. Chose the one that best supports your purposes.

* **Local Option:** Clone or fork the repo and **execute the workbooks locally** using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab (find instructions here: https://jupyter.org/install)

* **Online Option:** Launch a live nb server using binder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nancynobody/python3_fluency/master

**Want to create an site from your ipython notebooks like this?**

This is just a GitHub pages site that uses the [minima-ipynb theme](https://github.com/nancynobody/minima-ipynb) and is built using [`nbconvertjkl`](https://github.com/nancynobody/nbconvertjkl) python package to build the content from the `notebooks` folder!
