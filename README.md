# Interactive Workbooks / Tutorials for Data Science Practitioners

Interactive workbooks to help you master the skills you need to be an effective data scientist.

# Getting Started
Check out the [medium posts](https://medium.com/@mck.workman/data-science-mastery-part-1-3-numpy-and-matplotlib-7fa9891f5ead?source=friends_link&sk=e4b78b808a4da8879ab194a6ad3529d6) for detailed instructions if you are not familiar with running IPython notebooks.

I recomend that you go through the workbooks in the following order as they do build on each other.

- Numpy and Matplotlib
- Pandas and Seaborn
- Linear Algebra Foundations
- Linear Algebra Algorithms
