<sup><sub>ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR DATA SCIENCE PRACTITIONERS</sub></sup>

# Data Science Foundations

There are four foundational Python libraries that you need to master to be a good data scientist (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `seaborn`). These libraries allow you to play with and manipulate data, visualize and transform it. 

These workbooks are designed to help you master essential data science skills.

## Part 1 — Numpy and Matplotlib

**`numpy` is a Python library for manipulating multi-dimensional data.**

The Numpy Workbook will familiarize you with numpy’s capabilities (creating and manipulating multi-dimensional data) then provide exercises so you can get good at it.

**`matplotlib` is aPython library for data visualization**

The Matplotlib Workbook will walk you through usage patterns, basic plotting and advanced features. Matplotlib is really useful for plotting a wide variety of data however data scientists will frequently leverage other tools like Seaborn which works well for many common tasks.

## Part 2 — Pandas and Seaborn

First we focused on getting good at manipulating and visualizing data using Numpy and Matplotlib. Now, we will continue manipulating and visualizing data but do so with some libraries that are designed specifically for data analysis and visualization.

**`pandas` is a Python library designed for data analysis**

The Pandas Workbook will familiarize you with pandas data structures and as well as give you some exercises so you can practice working with sample datasets.

**`seaborn` is a Python library for data visualization**

The Seaborn Workbook will give you an overview of what is available in Seaborn, then walk you visual exploration of some sample datasets.

## Part 3 — Linear Algebra Mastery

In this section we get to the core of data science in machine learning by mastering the fundamentals of linear algebra. With these skills we will be able to explore datasets to an even greater degree.

We will cover matrix representations of data, matrix math, linearity and transformations and properties of matrices.
